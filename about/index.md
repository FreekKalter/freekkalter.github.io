# About me

My name is Freek Kalter, I am a 26 year old programmer from a little town in the Netherlands. My main language of choice used to be Perl, but recently for all new projects I started using [Go](http://golang.org). And I realy like it, so expect some posts about a couple programs I have written with it. 
Almost everything I do is on [github](https://github.com/FreekKalter), so check it out.
I am also interested in everything security related.
